- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ignaciosalasp
I am passionate about dealing with problems and the challenge of solving them using critical thinking. Furthermore, I feel quite amazed by the IT world and its continuous growth . I strongly desire to provide better opportunities worldwide by taking into consideration technological breakthroughs and optimizing the system with operational state-of-the-art research tools. As an industrial engineering major, I would like to look thoroughly into the companies' processes, in order to achieve optimal levels of efficiency always bearing in mind meeting the expected results. I truly believe in the powerful assets of teamwork and I am looking forward to having several other experiences.
